 The dataset used for this project is the well-known Titanic dataset, available from Kaggle, which contains information on passengers aboard the Titanic, 
 including their survival status.

This project uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. The goal is to classify passengers 
into two categories: those who survived and those who did not.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and model evaluation
Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

PassengerId: ID of the passenger
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = First Class, 2 = Second Class, 3 = Third Class)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Ticket fare
Cabin: Cabin number (not all passengers have this data)
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
Objective
The goal of the project is to predict the Survived column based on the other features. The project involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data distribution and relationships.
Model Training: Applying machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.
Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using accuracy and other metrics.
Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values: Some columns (like Age and Cabin) contain missing data, so these are imputed or dropped.
Feature encoding: Convert categorical variables like "Sex" and "Embarked" into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature scaling: Standardize numerical features (like Age, Fare) if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize survival rates based on various features.
Investigate the relationship between features such as age, gender, and passenger class.
Check for correlations between variables and identify important features for the prediction.
3. Model Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train multiple models including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Fine-tune the models using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model performance on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Compare the results of different models and select the best one.
5. Prediction
Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data (for example, test data or Kaggle competition test set).
